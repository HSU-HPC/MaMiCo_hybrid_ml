## 0_Data_Generation

This subdirectory contains a file structure of configurations in order to
generate the MD datasets. In this paper, we use the macro-micro coupling tool (MaMiCo)
to generate datasets based on Couette and Karman-Vortex-Street scenarios for molecular-continuum coupled flow simulations.

A few key simulation parameters are given in the following table.

**TO DO PIET: table of noteworthy MaMiCo parameters**

| temperature       | dimensionless         | 1.1     |


### 0_Couette

As for the Couette based scenarios, datasets are generated by varying the speed of $u_{wall} \in \[0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0\]$
and the position of the MD domain relative to the channel walls, e.g. top, middle, bottom.

### 1_KVS

As for the KVS based scenarios, datasets are generated by varying the number of init-timesteps and the position of the MD domain
relative to the cylindrical object.
